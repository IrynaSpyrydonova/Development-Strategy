## This website is all about learning how to use development strategies

In this project we learned how to structure our workflow via using branching.  

When you create a branch in your project, you're creating an environment where you can try out new ideas or features. Changes you make on a branch don't affect the master branch, so you're free to experiment and commit changes.

Please feel free to check out all the steps of this project.
